# Audio Example Plugin

A proof-of-concept plugin that provides very basic audio playback using local files.

I was also experimenting with the different ways it was possible to build a plugin. This one uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build, including use of Vite's local dev server should you use `npm run start` and switch the plugin to Development Mode.

### Development

To get up and running, open the plugin folder, run `npm install`, then `npm run dev` to use the plugin in dev mode and `npm run build` to build the production version.

Both versions should actually have working sourcemaps now which is nice!
